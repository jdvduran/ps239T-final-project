Existing law defines\ncriminal profiteering activity as any specified acts or threats made\nfor financial gain or advantage. Existing law requires a prosecuting\nagency to file a petition of forfeiture in conjunction with the\ncriminal proceeding for the underlying offense. </em> <em>\n   This bill would allow the prosecuting agency to file a petition of\nforfeiture prior to the commencement of the underlying criminal\nproceeding if the value of the assets seized exceeds $100000 there\nis a substantial probability that the prosecuting agency will file a\ncriminal complaint there is a substantial probability the\nprosecuting agency will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and\nfailure to enter the order will result in the property being\ndestroyed or otherwise removed from the jurisdiction of the court\nthe need to preserve the property outweighs the hardship on any party\nagainst whom the order is entered and there is a substantial\nprobability that the assets subject to forfeiture represent direct or\nindirect proceeds of criminal activity committed for the benefit of\nat the direction of or in association with a transnational\ncriminal organization as defined. The bill would allow a person\nclaiming an interest in the property or proceeds to move for return\nof the property on the grounds there is not probable cause to believe\nthat the property is subject to forfeiture and if the prosecuting\nagency does not establish substantial probability that the property\nis subject to forfeiture the court would be required to order the\nseized property returned. The bill would require the Attorney\nGeneral on or before January 1 2019 to report to the Governor and\nspecified committees on the use of these proceedings. The bill would\nprovide for the repeal of these changes on January 1 2020. </em>\n<strike>\n   (1) The Optometry Practice Act provides for the licensure and\nregulation of the practice of optometry by the State Board of\nOptometry and makes a violation of the act a crime. Existing law\nrequires individuals corporations and firms engaged in the business\nof filling prescriptions of physicians and surgeons and optometrists\nfor prescription lenses and kindred products to register with the\nDivision of Licensing of the Medical Board of California as a\nregistered dispensing optician and makes a violation of the\nprovisions governing registered dispensing opticians a crime.\n</strike> <strike>\n   (2) Existing law prohibits a licensed optometrist from having any\nmembership proprietary interest coownership landlord-tenant\nrelationship or any profit-sharing arrangement in any form whether\ndirectly or indirectly with any person licensed as a registered\ndispensing optician and prohibits a registered dispensing optician\nfrom having any membership proprietary interest coownership\nlandlord-tenant relationship or any profit-sharing arrangement in\nany form directly or indirectly with a licensed optometrist. Existing\nlaw also prohibits a licensed optometrist from having any\nmembership proprietary interest coownership landlord-tenant\nrelationship or any profit-sharing arrangement in any form directly\nor indirectly either by stock ownership interlocking directors\ntrusteeship mortgage trust deed or otherwise with any person who\nis engaged in the manufacture sale or distribution to physicians\nand surgeons optometrists or dispensing opticians of lenses\nframes optical supplies optometric appliances or devices or kindred\nproducts. Under existing law a violation of the above provisions by\na licensed optometrist and any person whether or not licensed who\nparticipates with a licensed optometrist in violating those\nprovisions constitutes a misdemeanor. </strike> <strike>\n   This bill would delete those provisions. The bill instead would\nprohibit a licensed registered dispensing optician or a manufacturer\nor distributor of optical goods that is renting or leasing office\nspace to or from sharing office space with or receiving space from\nan optometrist from engaging in conduct that would influence or\ninterfere with the clinical decisions as defined of that\noptometrist as specified. The bill would prohibit an optometrist\nthat is using or sharing office space with a registered dispensing\noptician from giving or receiving among other things a fee or thing\nof material value to or from any person in return for referral of\npatients or to secure patients. The bill would make a violation of\nthese provisions punishable as a misdemeanor. </strike> <strike>\n   (3) Existing law permits a certificate of a registered dispensing\noptician to be suspended revoked or subjected to probation for\nviolation of regulations or laws as specified or for incompetence\ngross negligence or repeated similar negligent acts by the\nregistrant or an employee as provided. </strike> <strike>\n   This bill would delete those provisions. The bill similarly would\npermit a certificate of a registered dispensing optician to be\nsuspended revoked or subjected to probation for violation of\nregulations or laws as specified or for incompetence gross\nnegligence or repeated negligent acts by the registrant or an\nemployee as provided and additionally would permit the certificate\nto be suspended revoked or subjected to probation for\nunprofessional conduct which includes repeated interference with the\noptometrist\'s clinical judgment or compliance with prevailing\nclinical standards. The bill authorizes assessment of administrative\nfines for violation of specified provisions of law and requires\nregistered dispensing opticians to cooperate with investigations into\na complaint or alleged violation of law. </strike> <strike>\n   (4) Under existing law it is unlawful for a registered dispensing\noptician to advertise the furnishing of or to furnish the services\nof a refractionist an optometrist or a physician and surgeon; to\ndirectly or indirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises\nused for optical dispensing a refractionist an optometrist a\nphysician and surgeon or a practitioner of any other profession for\nthe purpose of any examination or treatment of the eyes; or to\nduplicate or change lenses without a prescription or order from a\nperson duly licensed to issue the same. </strike> <strike>\n   This bill would delete those prohibitions. </strike> <strike>\n   (5) The Optometry Practice Act prohibits a person from having an\noffice for the practice of optometry unless he or she is licensed to\npractice optometry and requires an optometrist that has more than\none office to comply with certain provisions of the act including\namong others that an optometrist obtain a branch office license for\nany additional office. The act prohibits more than one branch office\nlicense from being issued to an optometrist or any 2 or more\noptometrists jointly. The act requires an optometrist that had a\nbranch office prior to January 1 1957 and who wants to continue\nthat branch office on or after that date to notify the board as\nspecified. </strike> <strike>\n   The bill would delete the prohibition of an optometrist or 2 or\nmore optometrists jointly from having more than one branch office\nand would delete the requirement that an optometrist that had a\nbranch office prior to January 1 1957 and who wants to continue\nthat branch office to notify the board. The bill would prohibit a\nperson from having any proprietary interest in an office for the\npractice of optometry unless he or she is licensed to practice\noptometry. The bill would specify that a branch office is any\nadditional office that is not the principal place of business of an\noptometrist as specified. </strike> <strike>\n   (6) The Optometry Practice Act prohibits an optometrist from\ndirectly or indirectly accepting employment from any person not\nhaving a valid unrevoked license as an optometrist except that the\nact authorizes an optometrist to be employed by a physician and\nsurgeon who practices in the specialty of ophthalmology or by a\nhealth care service plan. </strike> <strike>\n   This bill would require an optometrist to report to the State\nBoard of Optometry any action or circumstance that the optometrist\nreasonably and in good faith believes is an attempt by a registered\ndispensing optician or an employee or agent thereof to interfere\nwith the optometrist\'s independent clinical judgment or compliance\nwith prevailing clinical standards. The bill would require the State\nBoard of Optometry to report these complaints to the Division of\nLicensing of the Medical Board of California. </strike> <strike>\n   (7) The bill also would require the State Board of Optometry to\nreceive any complaint made to a state board or department related to\ncare provided to a patient by a licensed optometrist. </strike>\n<strike>\n   (8) A violation of the optometry laws and the law governing\nregistered dispensing opticians is a crime. Therefore by expanding\nthe scope of an existing crime this bill would impose a\nstate-mandated local program. </strike> <strike>\n   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local\nagencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the\nstate. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that\nreimbursement. </strike> <strike>\n   This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this\nact for a specified reason. </strike>\n   Vote: majority.

State Board of Optometry: optometrists: nonresident\ncontact lens sellers: registered dispensing opticians.\n   Existing law prohibits a licensed optometrist and a registered\ndispensing optician from having any membership proprietary interest\ncoownership landlord-tenant relationship or any profit-sharing\narrangement in any form directly or indirectly with each other.\nExisting law prohibits a licensed optometrist from having any\nmembership proprietary interest coownership landlord-tenant\nrelationship or any profit-sharing arrangement in any form directly\nor indirectly either by stock ownership interlocking directors\ntrusteeship mortgage trust deed or otherwise with any person who\nis engaged in the manufacture sale or distribution to physicians\nand surgeons optometrists or dispensing opticians of lenses\nframes optical supplies optometric appliances or devices or kindred\nproducts. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions by a\nlicensed optometrist and any other persons whether or not a healing\narts licensee who participates with a licensed optometrist subject\nto a crime.\n   Under existing law the Medical Board of California is responsible\nfor the registration and regulation of nonresident contact lens\nsellers and dispensing opticians. Existing law requires fees\ncollected from nonresident contact lens sellers to be deposited in\nthe Dispensing Opticians Fund and to be available upon\nappropriation to the Medical Board of California. Existing law\nrequires fees collected from registered dispensing optician to be\npaid into the Contingent Fund of the Medical Board of California.\nExisting law makes a violation of the registered dispensing optician\nprovisions a crime. Existing law the Optometry Practice Act makes\nthe State Board of Optometry responsible for the licensure and\nregulation of optometrists. A violation of the Optometry Practice Act\nis a crime. Existing law the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan\nAct of 1975 provides for the licensure and regulation of health care\nservice plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a\nwillful violation of the act a crime.\n   This bill would repeal those prohibitions. The bill would prohibit\na licensed optometrist from having any membership proprietary\ninterest coownership or any profit-sharing arrangement either by\nstock ownership interlocking directors trusteeship mortgage or\ntrust deed with any registered dispensing optician or any optical\ncompany as defined except as otherwise authorized. The bill would\nauthorize a registered dispensing optician or optical company to\noperate own or have an ownership interest in a health plan defined\nas a licensed health care service plan if the health plan does not\ndirectly employ optometrists to provide optometric services directly\nto enrollees of the health plan and would also provide for the\ndirect or indirect provision of products and services to the health\nplan or its contracted providers or enrollees or to other\noptometrists as specified. The bill would authorize an optometrist\na registered dispensing optician an optical company or a health\nplan to execute a lease or other written agreement giving rise to a\ndirect or indirect landlord-tenant relationship with an optometrist\nif specified conditions are contained in a written agreement as\nprovided. The bill would authorize the State Board of Optometry to\ninspect upon request an individual lease agreement and the bill\nwould require the landlord or tenant to comply. Because the failure\nto comply with that request would be a crime under specified acts\nthe bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would\nprohibit a registered dispensing optician from having any membership\nproprietary interest coownership or profit sharing arrangement\neither by stock ownership interlocking directors trusteeship\nmortgage or trust deed with an optometrist except as authorized.\nThe bill would make a violation of these provisions a crime. By\ncreating a new crime the bill would impose a state-mandated local\nprogram.\n   This bill would instead make the State Board of Optometry\nresponsible for the registration and regulation of nonresident\ncontact lens sellers and dispensing opticians. The bill would direct\nfees collected from registered dispensing opticians and persons\nseeking registration as a dispensing optician to be paid into the\nDispensing Opticians Fund and to be available upon appropriation\nto the State Board of Optometry. The bill would make various\nconforming changes in that regard.\n   Existing law requires each registered dispensing optician to\nconspicuously and prominently display at each registered location the\nname of the registrant\'s employee who is currently designated to\nhandle customer inquiries and complaints and the telephone number\nwhere he or she may be reached during business hours.\n   This bill would instead require specified consumer information to\nbe displayed. Because a violation of the registered dispensing\nprovisions would be a crime the bill would impose a state-mandated\nlocal program.\n   Existing law makes it unlawful to among other things advertise\nthe furnishing of or to furnish the services of a refractionist an\noptometrist or a physician and surgeon or to directly or\nindirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises used for\noptical dispensing a refractionist an optometrist a physician and\nsurgeon or a practitioner of any other profession for the purpose of\nany examination or treatment of the eyes.\n   This bill except as specified would make it unlawful for a\nregistered dispensing optician to among other things advertise the\nfurnishing of or to furnish the services of an optometrist or a\nphysician and surgeon or to directly employ an optometrist or\nphysician and surgeon for the purpose of any examination or treatment\nof the eyes. The bill would authorize the State Board of Optometry\nby regulation to impose and issue administrative fines and citations\nfor a violation of these provisions as specified. The bill would\nrequire all licensed optometrists in a setting with a registered\ndispensing optician to report the business relationship to the State\nBoard of Optometry. The bill would authorize the State Board of\nOptometry to inspect any premises at which the business of a\nregistered dispensing optician is co-located with the practice of an\noptometrist for the purposes of determining compliance with the\naforementioned written lease agreement provisions. The bill would\nalso authorize the State Board of Optometry to take disciplinary\naction against a party who fails to comply with the inspection and\nwould require the State Board of Optometry to provide specified\ncopies of the inspection results. Because would be a crime a\nviolation of the registered dispensing provisions would be a crime\nthe bill would impose a state-mandated local program\n   This bill until January 1 2019 would prohibit an individual\ncorporation or firm operating as a registered dispensing optician\nbefore the effective date of the bill or an employee of such an\nentity from being subject to any action for engaging in that\naforementioned unlawful conduct. Because a violation of the\nregistered dispensing provisions would be a crime the bill would\nimpose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require any\nhealth plan subject to these provisions to report to the State Board\nof Optometry in writing that certain percentages of its locations no\nlonger employ an optometrist by specified dates. The bill would\nrequire the State Board of Optometry to provide those reports to the\nDirector of Consumer Affairs and the Legislature.\n   Under existing law the State Board of Optometry consists of 11\nmembers 6 licensee members and 5 public members.\n   This bill would require one of the nonpublic members to be a\nregistered dispensing optician and would require the Governor to make\nthat appointment. The bill would establish a dispensing optician\ncommittee to advise and make recommendations to the board regarding\nthe regulation of dispensing opticians as provided. The bill would\nrequire the advisory committee to consist of 5 members including 2\nregistered dispensing opticians 2 public members and a member of\nthe State Board of Optometry.\n   Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that\nlimits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the\nwritings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings\ndemonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need\nfor protecting that interest.\n   This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local\nagencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the\nstate. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that\nreimbursement.\n   This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this\nact for a specified reason.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  SECTION 1.

Redevelopment: successor agencies to\nredevelopment agencies.\n   (1) Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community\ndevelopment agencies as of February 1 2012 and provides for the\ndesignation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the\ndissolved redevelopment agencies subject to review by oversight\nboards and to among other things make payments due for enforceable\nobligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any\nenforceable obligation. Existing law requires the Department of\nFinance to issue a finding of completion to a successor agency upon\nconfirmation by the county auditor-controller that specified payments\nhave been fully made by the successor agency. Existing law prohibits\na successor agency from entering into contracts with incurring\nobligations or making commitments to any entity as specified; or\nfrom amending or modifying existing agreements obligations or\ncommitments with any entity for any purpose. Existing law defines\n\enforceable obligation\"" for these purposes to generally exclude any\nagreements contracts or arrangements between the city county or\ncity and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former\nredevelopment agency.\n   This bill would authorize a successor agency if the successor\nagency has received a finding of completion to enter into or amend\nexisting contracts and agreements or otherwise administer projects\nin connection with enforceable obligations if the contract\nagreement or project will not commit new property tax funds or\notherwise adversely affect the flow of specified tax revenues or\npayments to the taxing agencies as specified.\n   The bill would specifically include within the definition of\n\""enforceable obligation\"" an agreement entered into by the\nredevelopment agency prior to June 30 2011 if the agreement relates\nto state highway infrastructure improvements to which the\nredevelopment agency committed funds pursuant to specified law.\n   (2) Existing law requires each successor agency to have an\noversight board composed of 7 members and requires each member to be\nappointed by a specified authority.\n   This bill would allow each appointing authority to appoint an\nalternate representative to serve on the oversight board as may be\nnecessary. This bill would provide that the alternative\nrepresentative has the same participatory and voting rights as all\nother attending members of the oversight board and would require the\nsuccessor agency to promptly notify the Department of Finance\nregarding the appointment of any alternate representative.\n   (3) Existing law requires the disposition of assets and properties\nof the former redevelopment agency as directed by the oversight\nboard as specified and suspends these requirements until the\nDepartment of Finance has approved a long-range property management\nplan as specified. Upon approval of a long-range property management\nplan the plan governs and supersedes all other provisions relating\nto the disposition and use of the real property assets of the former\nredevelopment agency. Existing law requires the property of a former\nredevelopment agency to be disposed of according to law if the\ndepartment has not approved a long-range property management plan by\nJanuary 1 2016.\n   This bill would authorize the department to require a compensation\nagreement or agreements but would prohibit the department from\nrequiring approval of the compensation agreement or agreements as\npart of the approval of a long-range property management plan. The\nbill would describe the criteria and standard to be applied by the\ndepartment in approving a long-range property management plan. The\nbill would require the department to approve long-range property\nmanagement plans as expeditiously as possible. This bill would also\nprovide that actions relating to the disposition of property after\napproval of a long-range property management plan do not require\nreview by the department.\n   Vote: majority.

Safe schools: Safe Place to Learn Act: lesbian\ngay bisexual transgender and questioning pupil resources.\n   Existing law establishes the system of public elementary and\nsecondary schools in this state and provides for the establishment\nof local educational agencies to operate these schools and provide\ninstruction to pupils. Existing law states the policy of the State of\nCalifornia to afford all persons in public schools regardless of\ntheir disability gender gender identity gender expression\nnationality race or ethnicity religion sexual orientation or any\nother specified characteristic equal rights and opportunities in the\neducational institutions of the state. Existing law the Safe Place\nto Learn Act requires the State Department of Education as part of\nits regular monitoring and review of a local educational agency to\nassess whether the local educational agency has among other things\nadopted a policy that prohibits discrimination harassment\nintimidation and bullying as specified and has publicized that\npolicy to pupils parents employees agents of the governing board\nand the general public.\n   This bill would require the department to also assess whether the\nlocal educational agency has provided to certificated schoolsite\nemployees who serve pupils in any of grades 7 to 12 inclusive\ninformation on existing schoolsite and community resources related to\nthe support of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and questioning\npupils as specified.\n\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  SECTION 1.  (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the\nfollowing:\n   (1) All pupils deserve and need safe and supportive school\nenvironments in which to learn.\n   (2) Despite much progress California lesbian gay bisexual\ntransgender and questioning (LGBTQ) pupils often face verbal\nphysical and online harassment which has significant effects on\ntheir academic achievement.\n   (3) In the Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network\'s (GLSEN) 2013\nNational School Climate Survey 91 percent of California LGBTQ\npupils reported hearing anti-LGBTQ remarks 7 in 10 reported being\ncalled names or threatened based on their sexual orientation nearly\none-third reported physical harassment or assault and 46 percent\nreported cyberbullying.\n   (4) These problems have direct effects on pupils\' school\nperformance. GLSEN survey data shows that the average grade point\naverage for LGBTQ pupils who have experienced harassment is\nsignificantly lower than for LGBTQ pupils who have not and that 30\npercent of LGBTQ pupils report frequently skipping class or missing\nwhole days of school because they felt unsafe at school.\n   (5) In spite of these problems research has shown that LGBTQ\npupils who are harassed or assaulted in school do not report these\nincidents to school staff primarily because they believe school\nstaff will not do anything about the problem.\n   (6) Creating supportive learning environments for LGBTQ pupils\nimproves pupil performance. Pupils in schools with peer support clubs\nreport less harassment and assault are more likely to report\nincidents when they occur and are less likely to miss school because\nof safety concerns.\n   (7) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nmonitors and funds local efforts to provide professional development\nfor educators on safe and supportive environments for LGBTQ pupils\nfoster schoolsite resources such as Gay Straight Alliance clubs and\n\safe spaces\"" for LGBTQ pupils and promote referrals to school and\ncommunity health professionals with experience providing support to\nLGBTQ pupils.\n   (8) CDC data shows that only 50 percent of California schools\nfacilitate access to schoolsite and community health resources for\nLGBTQ pupils and only 39 percent have peer support clubs.\n   (b) The Legislature therefore encourages school districts county\noffices of education and charter schools to provide information on\nexisting schoolsite and community resources as required by\nsubdivision (d) of Section 234.1 of the Education Code as part of a\nmore comprehensive effort to educate school staff on the support of\nLGBTQ pupils.\n  SEC. 2.

The information shall be\ntranslated pursuant to Section 48985.\n   (d) Provided incident to the publicizing described in subdivision\n(c) to certificated schoolsite employees who serve pupils in any of\ngrades 7 to 12 inclusive who are employed by the local educational\nagency information on existing schoolsite and community resources\nrelated to the support of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and\nquestioning (LGBTQ) pupils.

Under the act an interested person may\npetition the commission to add a species to or remove a species\nfrom either the list of endangered species or the list of threatened\nspecies and existing law requires the commission to consider the\npetition at a meeting as prescribed. Existing law until January 1\n2017 establishes additional procedures for the review of a petition\nincluding public hearings and public comment.\n   This bill would extend those procedures indefinitely.\n   (2) Existing law requires the Department of Fish and Wildlife to\ndevelop and implement a recovery strategy pilot program for coho\nsalmon.

The act defines a transportation network company\nas an organization whether a corporation partnership sole\nproprietor or other form operating in California that provides\nprearranged transportation services for compensation using an\nonline-enabled platform to connect passengers with drivers using\ntheir personal vehicles. A transportation network company is subject\nto regulation by the Public Utilities Commission which requires\namong other things a criminal background check of each participating\ndriver.

Existing law also provides for the Medi-Cal\nprogram which is administered by the State Department of Health Care\nServices under which qualified low-income individuals receive\nhealth care services. The Medi-Cal program is in part governed and\nfunded by federal Medicaid Program provisions.

Workforce development:\ndevelopmentally disabled individuals.\n   Existing law the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services\nAct authorizes the State Department of Developmental Services to\ncontract with regional centers to provide services and supports to\nindividuals with developmental disabilities. Existing law governs the\nhabilitation services provided for adult consumers of regional\ncenters including work activity programs as described and\nestablishes an hourly rate for supported employment services provided\nto consumers receiving individualized services. Existing law\nrequires the department contingent upon receiving federal financial\nparticipation to conduct a 4-year demonstration project to determine\nwhether community-based vocational development services will\nincrease employment outcomes for consumers and reduce purchase of\nservice costs for working age adults.\n   This bill would require on or before July 1 2017 the department\nto establish a Work Transition Project with a process for regional\ncenters to allow well coordinated forms of integrated services using\nallowable services under existing state and federal law and to assist\nin the state's efforts to reach compliance with the federal Home and\nCommunity-Based Services Waiver regulations. The bill would\nauthorize the department to waive certain regulations through the use\nof modifications that maintain the purpose of the regulation while\nallowing flexibility to expand activities and choices in service\nprogram settings. The bill would set a maximum rate of $40 per hour\nfor vendors to provide needed job readiness and support services\naimed at individualized transition services for consumers currently\nplaced in work activity programs and other similar day services\nrelated to work experience and work opportunities who choose to move\ntowards competitive integrated employment. The bill would require the\ndepartment to assess the <strike> decrease in </strike> <em> change\nin the amount of </em> time that it takes a consumer under these\nprovisions <em>  as compared to previous modes of service delivery\n</em> to become job ready and to transition into <strike> an\nintegrated work </strike> <em> a competitive integrated employment\n</em> setting and to report that information to the budget <strike>\ncommittee </strike> <em> and appropriate policy committees </em> of\neach house of the Legislature during the annual budget process.\n   Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes.\nState-mandated local program: no.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  SECTION 1.  (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that\nindividuals with developmental disabilities who are earning income do\nnot lose their vocational opportunities and earning power due to\nchanges related to the home- and community-based services settings\n<strike> rule due to the implementation of the Workforce Innovation\nand Opportunity Act. </strike> <em> rule. </em>\n   (b) Individuals with developmental disabilities struggle to find\ngainful employment. Unemployment among the people with developmental\ndisabilities has been estimated at more than 80 percent.\n   (c) California's Employment First Policy and changes to the\nfederal home- and community-based services settings rule require the\nstate to increase opportunities for individuals with developmental\ndisabilities to achieve competitive integrated employment.\n   (d) There are thousands of consumers today earning some income in\nexisting employment programs who are complying with current rules and\ndeserve specific attention during this transition period to ensure\nthey have the opportunity for and access to more integrated work\nsettings of their choice.\n   (e) In order to increase the self-sufficiency of adults with\ndevelopmental disabilities including increased earning capacity and\nreduced government benefit support it is important that the state\nimplement a program to provide opportunities for individuals to\nengage in job discovery and job readiness training to assist their\ntransition to more competitive integrated employment and to ensure\nemployment success.\n   (f) The Governor and the Legislature must address the growing need\nfor new models of assessment career training and expanding\nemployment opportunities and support options for adults with\ndevelopmental disabilities who currently work in less integrated work\nactivity programs and group supported employment earning less than\nminimum wage. If this population is left without purposefully\ndesigned pathways into more competitive integrated employment these\nadults will be at higher risk of public dependency throughout the\ncourse of their lives.\n  SEC. 2.  Section 4850.4 is added to the Welfare and Institutions\nCode to read:\n   4850.4.

The project\nshall assist in the state's efforts to reach compliance with the\nfederal Home and Community-Based Services Waiver regulations by March\n31 2019.\n   (2) Well coordinated forms of integrated services approved under\nthe project shall be eligible to receive available funding\nappropriated for transitioning programs toward compliance with the\nfederal Home and Community-Based Services Waiver regulations.\n   (b) (1) The department shall allow regional centers to increase\nopportunities for consumers by customizing skill development and\nemployability programs as appropriate by partnering with work\nactivity programs and other similar day services related to work\nexperience and work opportunities to support those consumers who\nchoose to move towards competitive integrated employment.\n   (2) The rate shall be no more than an equivalent of forty dollars\n($40) per hour for vendors to provide needed job readiness and\nsupport services aimed at individualized transition services for\nconsumers currently placed in work activity programs and other\nsimilar day services related to work experience and work\nopportunities who choose to move towards competitive integrated\nemployment. Hours of participation in job readiness and support\nservices may be provided in addition to or in lieu of the hours of\nparticipation in existing work activity programs and other similar\nday services as determined by the consumer's individual program\nplanning team.\n   (3) If necessary to provide flexibility from program requirements\nthat have the effect of social isolation and restricting community\nintegration activities the department may waive certain regulations\nthrough the use of modifications that maintain the purpose of the\nregulation while allowing flexibility to expand activities and\nchoices in service program settings including Sections 58820 and\n58821 of Title 17 and Sections 82079 and 82087.2 of Title 22 of the\nCalifornia Code of Regulations.\n   (c) (1) The department shall allow regional centers to support\ncareer pathway development by partnering with group supported\nemployment programs and other similar day services to support those\nconsumers who choose to move toward competitive integrated\nemployment.\n   (2) As determined by the consumer's individual program planning\nteam additional job coaching hours at the current established rate\nmay be authorized to provide career pathway development to support\nthose consumers who choose to move toward competitive integrated\nemployment.\n   (d) The department shall assess the <strike> decrease in </strike>\n<em> change in the amount of</em> time that it takes a consumer\nunder these <strike> provisions </strike> <em> provisions as\ncompared to previous modes of service delivery </em> to become job\nready and to transition into <strike> an integrated work </strike>\n<em> a competitive integrated employment</em> setting.
