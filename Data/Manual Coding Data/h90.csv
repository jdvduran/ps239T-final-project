Local government.\n   (1) Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community\ndevelopment agencies as of February 1 2012 and provides for the\ndesignation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the\ndissolved redevelopment agencies and to among other things make\npayments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations\nrequired pursuant to any enforceable obligation.\n   This bill would provide that any action by the Department of\nFinance that occurred on or after June 28 2011 carrying out the\ndepartment\'s obligations under the provisions described above\n<strike> constitute </strike> <em> constitutes </em> a department\naction for the preparation development or administration of the\nstate budget and is exempt from the Administrative Procedures Act.\n   (2) Existing law defines \administrative cost allowance\"" for the\npurposes of successor agencies\' duties in the winding down of the\naffairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies to mean an amount\nthat is payable from property tax revenues up to a certain percentage\nof the property tax allocated to the successor agency on the\nRecognized Obligation Payment Schedule covering a specified period\nand up to a certain percentage of the property tax allocated to the\nRedevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund that is allocated to the\nsuccessor agency for each fiscal year thereafter.\n   This bill would restate the definition of \""administrative cost\nallowance\"" as the maximum amount of administrative costs that may be\npaid by a successor agency from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust\nFund in a fiscal year. This bill would commencing July 1 2016 and\nfor each fiscal year thereafter limit the administrative cost\nallowance to an amount not to exceed 3% of the actual property tax\ndistributed to the successor agency for payment of approved\nenforceable obligations reduced by the successor agency\'s\nadministrative cost allowance and loan payments made to the city\ncounty or city and county that created the redevelopment agency as\nspecified and would limit a successor agency\'s annual administrative\ncosts to an amount not to exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment\nProperty Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations.\n   (3) Existing law excludes from the term \""administrative cost\nallowance\"" any administrative costs that can be paid from bond\nproceeds or from sources other than property tax any expenses\nrelated to assets or obligations settlements and judgments and the\ncosts of maintaining assets prior to disposition.\n   This bill would delete these exclusions and would further require\nthe \""administrative cost allowance\"" to be approved by the oversight\nboard and to be the sole funding source for any legal expenses\nrelated to civil actions contesting the validity of laws and actions\ndissolving and winding down the redevelopment agencies as specified.\n\n   (4) Existing law specifies that the term \""enforceable obligation\""\ndoes not include any agreements contracts or arrangements between\nthe city county or city and county that created the redevelopment\nagency and the former redevelopment agency as specified.\nNotwithstanding this provision existing law authorizes certain\nwritten agreements to be deemed enforceable obligations.\n   This bill would additionally authorize written agreements entered\ninto at the time of issuance but in no event later than June 27\n2011 solely for the refunding or refinancing of other indebtedness\nobligations that existed prior to January 1 2011 and solely for the\npurpose of securing or repaying the refunded or refinanced\nindebtedness obligations to be deemed enforceable obligations. This\nbill would provide that an agreement entered into by the\nredevelopment agency prior to June 28 2011 is an enforceable\nobligation if the agreement relates to state highway infrastructure\nimprovements as specified.\n   (5) Existing law authorizes the city county or city and county\nthat authorized the creation of a redevelopment agency to loan or\ngrant funds to a successor agency for administrative costs\nenforceable obligations or project related expenses at the city\'s\ndiscretion.\n   This bill would limit the authorization to loan or grant funds to\nthe payment of administrative costs or enforceable obligations\nexcluding loans approved pursuant to specified provisions and to the\ncase in which the successor agency receives an insufficient\ndistribution from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund or other\napproved sources of funding are insufficient to pay approved\nenforceable obligations as specified. This bill would require these\nloans to be repaid from the source of funds originally approved for\npayment of the underlying enforceable obligation as specified. This\nbill would require the interest on these loans to be calculated on a\nfixed annual simple basis and would specify the manner in which\nthese loans are required to be repaid.\n   (6) Existing law provides for the transfer of housing assets and\nfunctions previously performed by the dissolved redevelopment agency\nto one of several specified public entities. Existing law authorizes\nthe successor housing entity to designate the use of and commit\nproceeds from indebtedness that were issued for affordable housing\npurposes prior to January 1 2011 and were backed by the Low and\nModerate Income Housing Fund.\n   This bill would instead authorize a successor housing entity to\ndesignate the use of and commit proceeds from indebtedness that\nwere issued for affordable housing purposes prior to June 28 2011.\n   (7) Existing law authorizes the city county or city and county\nthat created a redevelopment agency to elect to retain the housing\nassets and functions previously performed by the redevelopment\nagency. Existing law requires that any funds transferred to the\nhousing successor together with any funds generated from housing\nassets be maintained in a separate Low and Moderate Income Housing\nAsset Fund to be used in accordance with applicable housing-related\nprovisions of the Community Redevelopment Law except as specified.\nExisting law requires the housing successor to provide an annual\nindependent financial audit of the fund to its governing body and to\npost on its Internet Web site specified information.\n   This bill would require that posted information to also include\nspecified amounts received by the city county or city and county.\n   (8) Existing law requires a successor agency to among other\nthings prepare a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule for payments\non enforceable obligations for each 6-month fiscal period.\n   This bill would revise the timeline for the preparation of the\nrequired Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to require the\nsuccessor agency to prepare a schedule for a one year fiscal period\nwith the first of these periods beginning July 1 2016 and would\nauthorize the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to be amended by\nthe oversight board once per Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule\nperiod if the oversight board makes a finding that a revision is\nnecessary for the payment of approved enforceable obligations as\nspecified.\n   This bill would beginning August 1 2015 <strike> require\n</strike> <em> authorize </em> successor agencies to submit a Last\nand Final Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule which shall list\nthe remaining enforceable obligations of the successor agency and the\ntotal outstanding obligation and a schedule of remaining payments\nfor each enforceable obligation for approval by the oversight board\nand the Department of Finance if specified conditions are met. This\nbill would require the department to review the Last and Final\nRecognized Obligation Payment Schedule as specified and would\nrequire upon approval by the department the Last and Final\nRecognized Obligation Payment Schedule to establish the maximum\namount of Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Funds to be distributed to\nthe successor agency as specified. This bill would authorize the\nsuccessor agencies to submit no more than two requests to the\ndepartment to amend the approved Last and Final Recognized Obligation\nPayment Schedule except as specified. This bill would also require\nthe county auditor-controller to review the Last and Final Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule and to continue to allocate <strike> to\nallocate </strike> moneys in the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust\nFund in a specified order of priority.\n   (9) Existing law prohibits successor agencies from creating new\nenforceable obligations except in compliance with an enforceable\nobligation that existed prior to June 28 2011. Notwithstanding this\nprovision existing law authorizes successor agencies to create\nenforceable obligations to conduct the work of winding down the\nredevelopment agency including hiring staff acquiring necessary\nprofessional administrative services and legal counsel and procuring\ninsurance. Existing law finds and declares that these provisions\nwhen enacted were declaratory of existing law.\n   This bill except as required by an enforceable obligation would\nexclude certain work from the authorization to create enforceable\nobligations and would prohibit a successor agency that is the city\ncounty or city and county that formed the redevelopment agency from\ncreating enforceable obligations to repay loans entered into between\nthe redevelopment agency and the city county or city and county\nexcept as otherwise provided. This bill would delete those findings\nand declarations and would apply the provisions described above\nretroactively to any successor agency or redevelopment agency actions\noccurring after June 27 2012.\n   (10) Existing law authorizes a successor agency to petition the\nDepartment of Finance if an enforceable obligation provides for an\nirrevocable commitment of property tax revenue and the allocation of\nthose revenues is expected to occur over time to provide written\nconfirmation that its determination of this enforceable obligation as\napproved in a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule is final and\nconclusive.\n   This bill would require the successor agency to petition the\ndepartment by electronic means and in a manner of the department\'s\nchoosing and would require the successor agency to provide a copy of\nthe petition to the county auditor-controller as provided. This\nbill would require the department to provide written confirmation of\napproval or denial of the request within 100 days of the date of the\nrequest.\n   (11) Existing law provides that agreements contracts or\narrangements between the city or county or city and county that\ncreated the redevelopment agency and the redevelopment agency are\ninvalid and shall not be binding on the successor agency except that\na successor entity wishing to enter or reenter into agreements with\nthe city county or city and county that formed the redevelopment\nagency may do so upon obtaining approval of its oversight board.\nExisting law prohibits a successor agency or an oversight board from\nexercising these powers to restore funding for an enforceable\nobligation that was deleted or reduced by the Department of Finance\nas provided.\n   This bill would delete that prohibition and would provide that a\nduly authorized written agreement entered into at the time of\nissuance but in no event later than June 27 2011 of indebtedness\nobligations solely for the refunding or refinancing of indebtedness\nobligations that existed prior to January 1 2011 and solely for the\npurpose of securing or repaying the refunded and refinanced\nindebtedness obligations is valid and may bind the successor agency.\n\n   This bill would prohibit an oversight board from approving any\nagreements between the successor agency and the city county or city\nand county that formed the redevelopment agency except as otherwise\nprovided and would prohibit a successor agency from entering or\nreentering into any agreements with the city county or city and\ncounty that formed the redevelopment agency except as otherwise\nprovided. This bill would also prohibit a successor agency or an\noversight board from exercising any powers to restore funding for any\nitem that was denied or reduced by the Department of Finance. This\nbill would apply these provisions retroactively to all agreements\nentered or reentered on and after June 27 2012.\n   (12) Existing law authorizes the Department of Finance to review\nan oversight board action and requires written notice and information\nabout all actions taken by an oversight board to be provided to the\ndepartment by electronic means and in a manner of the department\'s\nchoosing.\n   This bill would require the written notice and information\ndescribed above to be provided to the department as an approved\nresolution. This bill would provide that oversight boards are not\nrequired to submit certain actions for department approval.\n   (13) Existing law requires on and after July 1 2016 in each\ncounty where more than one oversight board was created as provided\nthat there be only one oversight board.\n   This bill except as otherwise provided commencing on and after\nJuly 1 2017 if more than one oversight board exists within a\ncounty would require the oversight board to be staffed by the county\nauditor-controller by another county entity selected by the county\nauditor-controller or by a city within the county selected by the\ncounty auditor-controller as specified. This bill would authorize\nthe county auditor-controller if only one successor agency exists\nwithin the county to designate the successor agency to staff the\noversight board. This bill commencing July 1 2017 in each county\nwhere more than 40 oversight boards were created would require 5\noversight boards as specified.\n   (14) Existing law requires an oversight board for a successor\nagency to cease to exist when all of the indebtedness of the\ndissolved redevelopment agency has been repaid.\n   This bill would instead generally require an oversight board to\ncease to exist when the successor agency has been formally dissolved\nas specified and would require a county oversight board to cease to\nexist when all successor agencies subject to its oversight have been\nformally dissolved as specified.\n   (15) Existing law upon full payment by a successor agency of\nspecified amounts due requires the Department of Finance to issue a\nfinding of completion as specified within 5 days.\n   This bill if a successor agency fails by December 31 2015 to\npay or to enter into a written installment plan with the Department\nof Finance for payment of specified amounts would prohibit the\nsuccessor agency from ever receiving a finding of completion. This\nbill if a successor agency city county or city and county pays\nor enters into a written installment plan with the Department of\nFinance for the payment of specified amounts and the successor\nagency city county or city and county subsequently receives a\nfinal judicial determination that reduces or eliminates the amounts\ndetermined would require an enforceable obligation to be created for\nthe reimbursement of the excess amounts paid and the obligation to\nmake any payments in excess of the amount determined by a final\ndetermination to be canceled. This bill if upon consultation with\nthe county auditor-controller the Department of Finance finds that a\nsuccessor agency city county or city and county has failed to\nfully make one or more payments agreed to in the written installment\nplan would prohibit specified provisions from applying to the\nsuccessor agency and would prohibit specified oversight board actions\nand any approved long-range property management plan from being\neffective.\n   (16) Existing law transfers all assets properties contracts\nleases books and records buildings and equipment of former\nredevelopment agencies as of February 1 2012 to the control of the\nsuccessor agency for administration as specified.\n   This bill would require the city county or city and county that\ncreated the former redevelopment agency to return to the successor\nagency certain assets cash and cash equivalents that were not\nrequired by an enforceable obligation as specified and other money\nor assets that were not required or authorized pursuant to an\neffective oversight board action or Recognized Obligation Payment\nSchedule. This bill would authorize certain amounts required to be\nreturned to the successor agency to be placed on a Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule by the successor agency for payment as an\nenforceable obligation subject to specified conditions.\n   (17) Existing law requires a request by a successor agency to\nenter into an agreement with the city county or city and county\nthat formed the redevelopment agency to first be approved by the\noversight board. Existing law provides that actions to reestablish\nany other agreements that are in furtherance of enforceable\nobligations with the city county or city and county that formed the\nredevelopment agency are invalid until they are included in an\napproved and valid Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule.\n   This bill would also require a request by the successor agency to\nreenter into an agreement as described above to first be approved by\nthe oversight board. This bill would also provide that actions to\nestablish any other authorized agreements as specified are invalid\nuntil they are included in an approved and valid Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule.\n   (18) Existing law requires the oversight board to direct the\nsuccessor agency to among other things dispose of all assets and\nproperties of the former redevelopment agency except that the\noversight board is authorized to instead direct the successor agency\nto transfer ownership of those assets that were constructed and used\nfor a governmental purpose such as roads school buildings parks\npolice and fire stations libraries and local agency administrative\nbuildings to the appropriate public jurisdiction as provided.\n   This bill would expand that authorization to include parking\nfacilities and lots dedicated solely to public parking that do not\ninclude properties that generate revenues in excess of reasonable\nmaintenance costs of the properties. This bill would authorize a\nsuccessor agency to amend its long-range property management plan\nonce solely to allow for retention of real properties that\nconstitute public parking lots as provided.\n   (19) Existing law requires from February 1 2012 to July 1\n2012 inclusive and for each fiscal year thereafter the county\nauditor-controller after deducting administrative costs to allocate\nproperty tax revenues in each Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund\nfirst to each local agency and school entity as provided.\n   This bill would require certain revenues attributable to a\nproperty tax rate approved by the voters of a city county city and\ncounty or special district to make payments in support of pension\nprograms or in support of capital projects and programs related to\nthe State Water Project and levied in addition to the general\nproperty tax rate be allocated to and when collected be paid into\nthe fund of that taxing entity unless those amounts are pledged as\nsecurity for the payment of any indebtedness obligation.\n   (20) Existing law requires certain estimates and accounts reported\nin recognized obligation payment schedules and transferred to the\nRedevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund to be subject to audit by\nthe county auditor-controller and the Controller.\n   This bill would instead require the estimates and accounts\ndescribed above to be reviewed by the county auditor-controller\nsubject to the Department of Finance\'s review and approval. This bill\nwould require a successor agency commencing October 1 2018 and\neach October 1 thereafter to submit the differences between actual\npayments and past estimated obligations on a Recognized Obligation\nPayment Schedule to the county auditor-controller for review and\nwould require the county-auditor controller to provide this\ninformation to the Department of Finance as specified.\n   (21) Existing law requires a successor agency when all of the\ndebt of a redevelopment agency has been retired or paid off to\ndispose of all remaining assets and terminate its existence within\none year of the final debt payment.\n   This bill would instead require when all of the enforceable\nobligations have been retired or paid off all real property has been\ndisposed of and all outstanding litigation has been resolved the\nsuccessor agency to submit to the oversight board a request with a\ncopy of the request to the county auditor-controller to formally\ndissolve the successor agency. This bill would also require if a\nredevelopment agency was not previously allocated property tax\nrevenue as specified the successor agency to submit to the\noversight board a request to formally dissolve the successor agency.\nThis bill would require the oversight board to approve these requests\nwithin 30 days and to submit the request to the Department of\nFinance for approval or denial as specified. This bill would require\nthe successor agency to take specified steps including notifying\nthe oversight board when the department approves a request to\nformally dissolve a successor agency. This bill would require the\noversight board upon receipt of notification from the successor\nagency to make certain verifications and adopt a final resolution of\ndissolution for the successor agency as specified. This bill would\nwhen a successor agency is finally dissolved with respect to any\nexisting community facilities district formed by a redevelopment\nagency require the legislative body of the city or county that\nformed the redevelopment agency to become the legislative body of the\ncommunity facilities district and any existing obligations of the\nformer redevelopment agency or its successor agency to become the\nobligations of the new legislative body of the community facilities\ndistrict.\n   (22) Existing law with respect to any successor agency that has\nbeen issued a finding of completion by the Department of Finance\ndeems loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency\nand the city county or city and county that created the\nredevelopment agency to be an enforceable obligation as provided.\nExisting law specifies the manner in which the interest on the loan\nshould be calculated and how the loan should be repaid. Existing law\nrequires repayments received by the city county or city and county\nthat formed the redevelopment agency to be used to retire certain\noutstanding amounts borrowed and owed including a distribution to\nthe Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund as provided. Existing\nlaw requires bond proceeds derived from bonds issued on or before\nDecember 31 2010 to be used for the purposes for which the bonds\nwere sold.\n   This bill would define \""loan agreements\"" for the purposes\ndescribed above. This bill would change the manner in which the\ninterest on the loan is calculated and would require moneys repaid\nto be applied first to the principal and second to the interest. This\nbill would require distributions to the Low and Moderate Income\nHousing Asset Fund to be subject to specified reporting requirements.\nThis bill would require bond proceeds derived from bonds issued on\nor before December 31 2010 in excess of the amounts needed to\nsatisfy approved enforceable obligations to be expended in a manner\nconsistent with the original bond covenants. This bill would require\nbond proceeds derived from bonds issued on or after January 1 2011\nin excess of amounts needed to satisfy approved enforceable\nobligations to be used in a manner consistent with the original bond\ncovenants subject to specified conditions. This bill would apply\nthese provisions and the provisions relating to any successor agency\nthat has been issued a finding of completion by the Department of\nFinance described above retroactively to actions occurring on or\nafter June 28 2011. This bill would also provide that specified\nchanges to existing law shall not result in the denial of specified\nloans previously approved by the Department of Finance and shall not\nimpact judgments writs of mandate and orders entered by the\nSacramento Superior Court in specified lawsuits.\n   (23) Existing law requires a successor agency to prepare a\nlong-range property management plan that addresses the disposition\nand use of the real properties of the former redevelopment agency.\n   This bill would require if the former redevelopment agency did\nnot have real properties the successor agency to prepare a\nlong-range property management plan as provided.\n   (24) Existing law authorizes successor agencies to among other\nthings issue bonds or incur indebtedness to refund the bonds or\nindebtedness of a former redevelopment agency or to finance debt\nservice spikes as specified. The issuance of bonds or incurrence of\nother indebtedness by a successor agency is subject to the approval\nof the oversight board of the successor agency.\n   This bill would authorize the successor agency to the\nRedevelopment Agency of the City and County of San Francisco to have\nthe authority rights and powers of the Redevelopment Agency to\nwhich it succeeded solely for the purpose of issuing bonds or\nincurring other indebtedness to finance the construction of\naffordable housing and infrastructure required by specified\nagreements subject to the approval of the oversight board. The bill\nwould provide that bonds or other indebtedness authorized by its\nprovisions would be considered indebtedness incurred by the dissolved\nredevelopment agency would be listed on the Recognized Obligation\nPayment Schedule and would be secured by a pledge of moneys\ndeposited into the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund. The bill\nwould also require the successor agency to make diligent efforts to\nobtain the lowest long-term cost financing and to make use of an\nindependent financial advisor in developing financing proposals.\n   This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to\nthe necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San\nFrancisco.\n   (25) Existing law requires the county auditor for a county for\nwhich a negative sum was calculated pursuant to a specified former\nstatute in reducing the amount of property tax revenue otherwise\nallocated to the county by an amount attributable to that negative\nsum to apply a reduction amount equal to or based on the reduction\namount determined for specified fiscal years.\n   This bill for the 2015-16 fiscal year and each fiscal year\nthereafter would prohibit the county auditor from applying the\nreduction amount.\n   (26) Existing property tax law requires the county auditor in\neach fiscal year to allocate property tax revenue to local\njurisdictions in accordance with specified formulas and\n                                procedures and generally requires\nthat each jurisdiction be allocated an amount equal to the total of\nthe amount of revenue allocated to that jurisdiction in the prior\nfiscal year subject to certain modifications and that jurisdiction\'\ns portion of the annual tax increment as defined. Existing law\nprovides for the computation on the basis of these allocations of\napportionment factors that are applied to actual property tax\nrevenues in each county in order to determine actual amounts of\nproperty tax revenue received by each recipient jurisdiction.\n   This bill would deem to be correct those property tax revenue\napportionment factors that were applied in allocating property tax\nrevenues in the County of San Benito for each fiscal year through the\n2000-01 fiscal year. This bill would notwithstanding specified\naudit requirements require the county auditor to make the allocation\nadjustments identified in the State Controller\'s audit of the County\nof San Benito for the 2001-02 fiscal year. The bill would\nadditionally require property tax apportionment factors applied in\nallocating property tax revenue in the County of San Benito for the\n2002-03 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter to be determined\non the basis of apportionment factors for prior fiscal years that\nhave been corrected or adjusted as would be required if those prior\napportionment factors were not deemed correct by this bill.\n   This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to\nthe necessity of a special statute for the County of San Benito.\n   (27) Existing property tax law reduces the amounts of ad valorem\nproperty tax revenue that would otherwise be annually allocated to\nthe county cities and special districts pursuant to general\nallocation requirements by requiring for purposes of determining\nproperty tax revenue allocations in each county for the 1992-93 and\n1993-94 fiscal years that the amounts of property tax revenue deemed\nallocated in the prior fiscal year to the county cities and\nspecial districts be reduced in accordance with certain formulas. It\nrequires that the revenues not allocated to the county cities and\nspecial districts as a result of these reductions be transferred to\nthe Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF) in that county for\nallocation to school districts community college districts and the\ncounty office of education.\n   Existing property tax law requires the auditor of each county with\nqualifying cities as defined to make certain property tax revenue\nallocations to those cities in accordance with a specified Tax Equity\nAllocation (TEA) formula established in a specified statute and to\nmake corresponding reductions in the amount of property tax revenue\nthat is allocated to the county. Existing law requires the auditor of\nSanta Clara County for the 2006-07 fiscal year and for each fiscal\nyear thereafter to reduce the amount of property tax revenue\nallocated to qualified cities in that county by the ERAF\nreimbursement amount as defined and to commensurately increase the\namount of property tax revenue allocated to the county ERAF as\nspecified.\n   This bill would instead for the 2015-16 fiscal year and for each\nfiscal year thereafter require the auditor of Santa Clara County to\nreduce the amount of property tax revenues that are required to be\nallocated from the qualified cities in that county to the county ERAF\nby a specified percentage of the ERAF reimbursement amount. This\nbill would prohibit the auditor of Santa Clara County from reducing\nthe amounts allocated to the county ERAF in any fiscal year in which\nthe amount of moneys required to be applied by the state for the\nsupport of school districts and community college districts is\ndetermined pursuant to Test 1 of Proposition 98.\n   This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to\nthe necessity of a special statute for the County of Santa Clara.\n   (28) This bill would appropriate $23750000 from the General Fund\nto the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection contingent upon\nthe County of Riverside agreeing to forgive amounts owed to it by\ncertain cities.\n   (29) By imposing new duties upon local government officials with\nrespect to the wind down of the dissolved redevelopment agencies and\nin the annual allocation of ad valorem property tax revenues this\nbill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local\nagencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the\nstate. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that\nreimbursement.\n   This bill would provide that if the Commission on Stat",
" Mandates\ndetermines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state\nreimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these\nstatutory provisions.\n   (30) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately\nas a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.\n   Vote: majority. Appropriation: yes. Fiscal committee: yes.\nState-mandated local program: yes.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  SECTION 1.  Section 34170.1 is added to the Health and Safety Code\nto read:\n   34170.1.  Any action by the department carrying out the department\'\ns obligations under this part and Part 1.8 (commencing with Section\n34161) constitutes a department action for the preparation\ndevelopment or administration of the state budget pursuant to\nSection 11357 of the Government Code and is exempt from Chapter 3.5\n(commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of\nthe Government Code. This section applies retroactively to any\naction by the department described in this section that occurred on\nor after June 28 2011.\n  SEC. 2.

In addition the successor agency is\nrequired to fund and develop public infrastructure in the Transbay\nRedevelopment Project Area pursuant to the Transbay Implementation\nAgreement which is necessary to improve the area surrounding the\nTransbay Transit Center.\n   (c) Due to insufficient property tax revenues in the Redevelopment\nProperty Tax Trust Fund of the total number of affordable housing\nunits that the successor agency is obligated to fund and develop\nunder the enforceable obligations described in subdivision (a) the\nsuccessor agency has been able to finance the construction of only\n642 units. Additionally the successor agency has not been able to\nfulfill its public infrastructure obligation under the Transbay\nImplementation Agreement.\n   (d) The successor agency can more expeditiously construct the\n3361 additional units of required affordable housing and the\nnecessary infrastructure improvements if it is able to issue bonds or\nincur other indebtedness secured by property tax revenues available\nin the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund to finance these\nobligations.\n   (e) It is the intent of the Legislature to authorize the successor\nagency to issue bonds or incur other indebtedness for the purpose of\nfinancing the construction of affordable housing and infrastructure\nrequired under the enforceable obligations described in subdivision\n(a). These bonds or other indebtedness may be secured by property tax\nrevenues available in the successor agency\'s Redevelopment Property\nTax Trust Fund from those project areas that generated tax increment\nfor the Redevelopment Agency of the City and County of San Francisco\nupon its dissolution if the revenues are not otherwise obligated.\n   (f) Authorizing the successor agency to issue bonds or incur other\nindebtedness to finance the enforceable obligations described in\nsubdivision (a) will financially benefit the affected taxing\nentities insofar as it will ensure that funds which would otherwise\nflow to those entities as \""residual\"" payments pursuant to paragraph\n(4) of subdivision (a) of Section 34183 of the Health and Safety Code\nwill not be redirected to fund these enforceable obligations.\nInstead the enforceable obligations will be funded with the proceeds\nof the bonds or debt issuances.\n   (g) The housing situation in the City and County of San Francisco\nis unique in that median rents and sales prices are among the\nhighest in the state. Because of this the City and County of San\nFrancisco is currently facing an affordable housing crisis.\n  SEC. 28.

Brown Jr. issued an Executive order on\nApril 1 2015 which for the first time in California history\ndirects the State Water Resources Control Board to implement\nmandatory water reductions across the state to reduce water usage by\n25 percent.\n   (c) One component of the Governor's Executive order compels the\nreplacement of 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state\nwith drought tolerant landscaping.\n   (d) Among a wide variety of drought tolerant landscaping are a\nvariety of native plants and landscaping alternatives including the\ninstallation of synthetic grass or artificial turf.\n   (e) According to the Department of Water Resources landscape\nirrigation represents 43 percent of urban water use. The installation\nof synthetic grass or artificial turf in lieu of conventional lawns\nand landscapes can directly reduce outdoor water use to help meet\nthe Governor's mandated 25-percent statewide water use reduction.\n  SEC. 2.  Section 53087.7 is added to the Government Code to read:\n   53087.7.  (a) A city including a charter city county or city\nand county shall not enact any ordinance or regulation or enforce\nany existing ordinance or regulation that prohibits the installation\nof drought tolerant landscaping synthetic grass or artificial turf\non residential property.\n   (b) A city including a charter city county or city and county\nmay impose reasonable restrictions on the type of drought tolerant\nlandscaping synthetic grass or artificial turf that may be\ninstalled on residential property provided that those restrictions do\nnot do any of the following:\n   (1) Substantially increase the cost of installing drought tolerant\nlandscaping synthetic grass or artificial turf.\n   (2) Effectively prohibit the installation of drought tolerant\nlandscaping synthetic grass or artificial turf.\n   (3) Significantly impede the installation of drought tolerant\nlandscaping including but not limited to a requirement that a\nresidential yard must be completely covered with living plant\nmaterial.\n  SEC. 3.  The Legislature finds and declares the prolonged drought\nalong with climate change requires the state to address water\nconservation goals that will have long-term impacts in this state.\nThe Legislature further finds and declares that drought tolerant\nlandscaping including the installation of synthetic grass or\nartificial turf is a viable landscaping alternative that will\nfurther the goal of addressing long-term water conservation.\nTherefore allowing property owners in this state to install drought\ntolerant landscaping synthetic grass or artificial turf on their\nresidential properties is a matter of statewide concern not a\nmunicipal affair as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of\nthe California Constitution.\n  SEC. 4.  This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate\npreservation of the public peace health or safety within the\nmeaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate\neffect.

Energy: greenhouse gas reduction.\n   (1) Under existing law the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has\nregulatory authority over public utilities. Existing law requires the\nPUC to require the administration until January 1 2021 of a\nself-generation incentive program for distributed generation\nresources and energy storage technologies. Existing law authorizes\nthe PUC in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation\nand Development Commission to authorize the annual collection of\nnot more than the amount authorized for the program in the 2008\ncalendar year.\n   This bill would increase the maximum annual collection the PUC may\nauthorize for the program to double the amount authorized for the\nprogram in the 2008 calendar year.\n   (2) Existing law requires an electrical corporation to file with\nthe PUC a standard tariff providing for net energy meeting for\neligible fuel cell customer-generators and make the tariff available\non a first-come-first-served basis until the total cumulative rated\ngenerating capacity of the eligible fuel cell electrical generating\nfacilities receiving service pursuant to the tariff reaches a level\nequal to the electrical corporation\'s proportionate share of a\nstatewide limitation of 500 megawatts cumulative rated generation\ncapacity served (program cap). Existing law requires the eligible\nfuel cell customer-generator to meet certain requirements including\nrequirements that the customer-generator uses: (A) a fuel cell\nelectrical generation facility with a capacity of not more than one\nmegawatt and (B) technology the PUC has determined will achieve\ncertain reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. Existing law\nprovides that fuel cell electrical generation facilities are not\neligible for the tariff unless the facilities commence operation\nprior to January 1 2017.\n   This bill would increase the program cap by authorizing 500\nmegawatts in addition to the total installed capacity as of January\n1 2017. The bill would increase to 5 megawatts the maximum amount of\ngeneration capacity for a fuel cell electrical generation facility\nin the program. The bill would require by March 31 2017 the State\nAir Resources Board in consultation with the Energy Commission to\nestablish a schedule of annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction\nstandards as specified for fuel cell electrical generation\nresources and would require the PUC to determine if the technology\nused by the eligible fuel cell customer-generator will achieve those\nstandards. The bill would require the fuel cell electrical generation\nresource to comply with emission standards adopted by the State Air\nResources Board under the distributed generation certification\nprogram.\n   This bill would provide that fuel cell electrical generation\nfacilities are not eligible for the tariff unless the facilities\ncommence operation on or before December 31 2021.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  SECTION 1.  Section 379.6 of the Public Utilities Code is amended\nto read:\n   379.6.

On January 1 2021 the\ncommission shall provide repayment of all unallocated funds collected\npursuant to this section to reduce ratepayer costs.\n   (3) The commission shall administer solar technologies separately\npursuant to the California Solar Initiative adopted by the\ncommission in Decisions 05-12-044 and 06-01-024 as modified by\nArticle 1 (commencing with Section 2851) of Chapter 9 of Part 2 of\nDivision 1 of this code and Chapter 8.8 (commencing with Section\n25780) of Division 15 of the Public Resources Code.\n   (b) (1) Eligibility for incentives under the self-generation\nincentive program shall be limited to distributed energy resources\nthat the commission in consultation with the State Air Resources\nBoard determines will achieve reductions in emissions of greenhouse\ngases pursuant to the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006\n(Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and\nSafety Code).\n   (2) On or before July 1 2015 the commission shall update the\nfactor for avoided greenhouse gas emissions based on the most recent\ndata available to the State Air Resources Board for greenhouse gas\nemissions from electricity sales in the self-generation incentive\nprogram administrators\' service areas as well as current estimates of\ngreenhouse gas emissions over the useful life of the distributed\nenergy resource including consideration of the effects of the\nCalifornia Renewables Portfolio Standard.\n   (c) Eligibility for the funding of any combustion-operated\ndistributed generation projects using fossil fuel is subject to all\nof the following conditions:\n   (1) An oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions rate standard of 0.07\npounds per megawatthour and a minimum efficiency of 60 percent or\nany other NOx emissions rate and minimum efficiency standard adopted\nby the State Air Resources Board. A minimum efficiency of 60 percent\nshall be measured as useful energy output divided by fuel input. The\nefficiency determination shall be based on 100 percent load.\n   (2) Combined heat and power units that meet the 60-percent\nefficiency standard may take a credit to meet the applicable NOx\nemissions standard of 0.07 pounds per megawatthour. Credit shall be\nat the rate of one megawatthour for each 3400000 British thermal\nunits (Btus) of heat recovered.\n   (3) The customer receiving incentives shall adequately maintain\nand service the combined heat and power units so that during\noperation the system continues to meet or exceed the efficiency and\nemissions standards established pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2).\n   (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) a project that does not meet\nthe applicable NOx emissions standard is eligible if it meets both of\nthe following requirements:\n   (A) The project operates solely on waste gas.

Net energy\nmetering shall be accomplished using a time-of-use meter capable of\nregistering the flow of electricity in two directions. If the\nexisting electrical meter of an eligible fuel cell customer-generator\nis not capable of measuring the flow of electricity in two\ndirections the eligible fuel cell customer-generator shall be\nresponsible for all expenses involved in purchasing and installing a\nmeter that is able to measure electricity flow in two directions. If\nan additional meter or meters are installed the net energy metering\ncalculation shall yield a result identical to that of a time-of-use\nmeter.\n   (b) (1) Not later than March 31 2017 the State Air Resources\nBoard in consultation with the Energy Commission shall establish a\nschedule of annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction standards for a\nfuel cell electrical generation resource for purposes of clause\n(iii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) and\nshall update the schedule every three years with applicable standards\nfor each intervening year.\n   (2) The greenhouse gas emissions reduction standards shall ensure\nthat each fuel cell electrical generation resource for purposes of\nclause (iii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a)\nreduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to the electrical grid\nresources including renewable resources that the fuel cell\nelectrical generation resource displaces accounting for both\nprocurement and operation of the electrical grid.\n   (c) (1) Every electrical corporation not later than March 1\n2004 shall file with the commission a standard tariff providing for\nnet energy metering for eligible fuel cell customer-generators\nconsistent with this section. Subject to the limitation in\nsubdivision (g) every electrical corporation shall make this tariff\navailable to eligible fuel cell customer-generators upon request on\na first-come-first-served basis until the total cumulative rated\ngenerating capacity of the eligible fuel cell electrical generating\nfacilities receiving service pursuant to the tariff in addition to\nthe installed capacity as of January 1 2017 reaches a level equal\nto its proportionate share of a statewide limitation of 500 megawatts\ncumulative rated generation capacity served under this section. The\nproportionate share shall be calculated based on the ratio of the\nelectrical corporation\'s peak demand compared to the total statewide\npeak demand.\n   (2) To continue the growth of the market for onsite electrical\ngeneration using fuel cells the commission may review and\nincrementally raise the limitation established in paragraph (1) on\nthe total cumulative rated generating capacity of the eligible fuel\ncell electrical generating facilities receiving service pursuant to\nthe tariff in paragraph (1).\n   (d) In determining the eligibility for the cumulative rated\ngenerating capacity within an electrical corporation\'s service\nterritory preference shall be given to facilities that at the time\nof installation are located in a community with significant exposure\nto air contaminants or localized air contaminants or both\nincluding but not limited to communities of minority populations or\nlow-income populations or both based on the ambient air quality\nstandards established pursuant to Division 26 (commencing with\nSection 39000) of the Health and Safety Code.\n   (e) (1) Each net energy metering contract or tariff shall be\nidentical with respect to rate structure all retail rate\ncomponents and any monthly charges to the contract or tariff to\nwhich the customer would be assigned if the customer was not an\neligible fuel cell customer-generator. Any new or additional demand\ncharge standby charge customer charge minimum monthly charge\ninterconnection charge or other charge that would increase an\neligible fuel cell customer-generator\'s costs beyond those of other\ncustomers in the rate class to which the eligible fuel cell\ncustomer-generator would otherwise be assigned are contrary to the\nintent of the Legislature in enacting this section and shall not\nform a part of net energy metering tariffs.\n   (2) The commission shall authorize an electrical corporation to\ncharge a fuel cell customer-generator a fee based on the cost to the\nutility associated with providing interconnection inspection services\nfor that fuel cell customer-generator.\n   (f) The net metering calculation shall be made by measuring the\ndifference between the electricity supplied to the eligible fuel cell\ncustomer-generator and the electricity generated by the eligible\nfuel cell customer-generator and fed back to the electrical grid over\na 12-month period. The following rules shall apply to the annualized\nmetering calculation:\n   (1) The eligible fuel cell customer-generator shall at the end of\neach 12-month period following the date of final interconnection of\nthe eligible fuel cell electrical generating facility with an\nelectrical corporation and at each anniversary date thereafter be\nbilled for electricity used during that period. The electrical\ncorporation shall determine if the eligible fuel cell\ncustomer-generator was a net consumer or a net producer of\nelectricity during that period. For purposes of determining if the\neligible fuel cell customer-generator was a net consumer or a net\nproducer of electricity during that period the electrical\ncorporation shall aggregate the electrical load of the meters located\non the property where the eligible fuel cell electrical generating\nfacility is located and on all property adjacent or contiguous to the\nproperty on which the facility is located if those properties are\nsolely owned leased or rented by the eligible fuel cell\ncustomer-generator. Each aggregated account shall be billed and\nmeasured according to a time-of-use rate schedule.\n   (2) At the end of each 12-month period where the electricity\nsupplied during the period by the electrical corporation exceeds the\nelectricity generated by the eligible fuel cell customer-generator\nduring that same period the eligible fuel cell customer-generator is\na net electricity consumer and the electrical corporation shall be\nowed compensation for the eligible fuel cell customer-generator\'s net\nkilowatthour consumption over that same period. The compensation\nowed for the eligible fuel cell customer-generator\'s consumption\nshall be calculated as follows:\n   (A) The generation charges for any net monthly consumption of\nelectricity shall be calculated according to the terms of the tariff\nto which the same customer would be assigned to or be eligible for if\nthe customer was not an eligible fuel cell customer-generator. When\nthe eligible fuel cell customer-generator is a net generator during\nany discrete time-of-use period the net kilowatthours produced shall\nbe valued at the same price per kilowatthour as the electrical\ncorporation would charge for retail kilowatthour sales for\ngeneration exclusive of any surcharges during that same time-of-use\nperiod. If the eligible fuel cell customer-generator\'s time-of-use\nelectrical meter is unable to measure the flow of electricity in two\ndirections paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) shall apply. All other\ncharges other than generation charges shall be calculated in\naccordance with the eligible fuel cell customer-generator\'s\napplicable tariff and based on the total kilowatthours delivered by\nthe electrical corporation to the eligible fuel cell\ncustomer-generator. To the extent that charges for transmission and\ndistribution services are recovered through demand charges in any\nparticular month no standby reservation charges shall apply in that\nmonthly billing cycle.\n   (B) The net balance of moneys owed shall be paid in accordance\nwith the electrical corporation\'s normal billing cycle.\n   (3) At the end of each 12-month period where the electricity\ngenerated by the eligible fuel cell customer-generator during the\n12-month period exceeds the electricity supplied by the electrical\ncorporation during that same period the eligible fuel cell\ncustomer-generator is a net electricity producer and the electrical\ncorporation shall retain any excess kilowatthours generated during\nthe prior 12-month period. The eligible fuel cell customer-generator\nshall not be owed any compensation for those excess kilowatthours.\n   (4) If an eligible fuel cell customer-generator terminates service\nwith the electrical corporation the electrical corporation shall\nreconcile the eligible fuel cell customer-generator\'s consumption and\nproduction of electricity during any 12-month period.\n   (g) A fuel cell electrical generating facility shall not be\neligible for the tariff unless it commences operation on or before\nDecember 31 2021 unless a later enacted statute that is chaptered\non or before December 31 2021 extends this eligibility commencement\ndate. The tariff shall remain in effect for an eligible fuel cell\nelectrical generating facility that commences operation pursuant to\nthe tariff on or before December 31 2021. A fuel cell\ncustomer-generator shall be eligible for the tariff established\npursuant to this section only for the operating life of the eligible\nfuel cell electrical generating facility.\n<br>\n            '""",1683

Local government.\n   (1) Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community\ndevelopment agencies as of February 1 2012 and provides for the\ndesignation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the\ndissolved redevelopment agencies and to among other things make\npayments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations\nrequired pursuant to any enforceable obligation.\n   This bill would provide that any action by the Department of\nFinance that occurred on or after June 28 2011 carrying out the\ndepartment\'s obligations under the provisions described above\nconstitutes a department action for the preparation development or\nadministration of the state budget and is exempt from the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.\n   (2) Existing law defines \administrative cost allowance\"" for the\npurposes of successor agencies\' duties in the winding down of the\naffairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies to mean an amount\nthat is payable from property tax revenues up to a certain percentage\nof the property tax allocated to the successor agency on the\nRecognized Obligation Payment Schedule covering a specified period\nand up to a certain percentage of the property tax allocated to the\nRedevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund that is allocated to the\nsuccessor agency for each fiscal year thereafter.\n   This bill would restate the definition of \""administrative cost\nallowance\"" as the maximum amount of administrative costs that may be\npaid by a successor agency from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust\nFund in a fiscal year. This bill would commencing July 1 2016 and\nfor each fiscal year thereafter limit the administrative cost\nallowance to an amount not to exceed 3% of the actual property tax\ndistributed to the successor agency for payment of approved\nenforceable obligations reduced by the successor agency\'s\nadministrative cost allowance and loan payments made to the city\ncounty or city and county that created the redevelopment agency as\nspecified and would limit a successor agency\'s annual administrative\ncosts to an amount not to exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment\nProperty Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations.\n   (3) Existing law excludes from the term \""administrative cost\nallowance\"" any administrative costs that can be paid from bond\nproceeds or from sources other than property tax any litigation\nexpenses related to assets or obligations settlements and judgments\nand the costs of maintaining assets prior to disposition.\n   This bill would delete these exclusions and would further require\nthe \""administrative cost allowance\"" to be approved by the oversight\nboard and to be the sole funding source for any legal expenses\nrelated to civil actions brought by the successor agency or the city\ncounty or city and county that created the former redevelopment\nagency contesting the validity of laws and actions dissolving and\nwinding down the redevelopment agencies as specified.\n   (4) Existing law specifies that the term \""enforceable obligation\""\ndoes not include any agreements contracts or arrangements between\nthe city county or city and county that created the redevelopment\nagency and the former redevelopment agency as specified.\nNotwithstanding this provision existing law authorizes certain\nwritten agreements to be deemed enforceable obligations.\n   This bill would specify that an agreement between a city county\nor city and county that created the former redevelopment agency and\nthe former redevelopment agency is an enforceable obligation if that\nagreement requires the former redevelopment agency to repay or\nfulfill an outstanding loan or development obligation imposed by a\ngrant or loan awarded or issued by a federal agency to the city\ncounty or city and county which subsequently loaned or provided\nthose funds to the former redevelopment agency.\n   This bill would additionally authorize written agreements entered\ninto at the time of issuance but in no event later than June 27\n2011 solely for the refunding or refinancing of other indebtedness\nobligations that existed prior to January 1 2011 and solely for the\npurpose of securing or repaying the refunded or refinanced\nindebtedness obligations to be deemed enforceable obligations. This\nbill would provide that an agreement entered into by the\nredevelopment agency prior to June 28 2011 is an enforceable\nobligation if the agreement relates to state highway infrastructure\nimprovements as specified.\n   (5) Existing law authorizes the city county or city and county\nthat authorized the creation of a redevelopment agency to loan or\ngrant funds to a successor agency for administrative costs\nenforceable obligations or project-related expenses at the city\'s\ndiscretion.\n   This bill would limit the authorization to loan or grant funds to\nthe payment of administrative costs or enforceable obligations\nexcluding loans approved pursuant to specified provisions and only\nto the extent the successor agency receives an insufficient\ndistribution from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund or other\napproved sources of funding are insufficient to pay approved\nenforceable obligations as specified. This bill would require these\nloans to be repaid from the source of funds originally approved for\npayment of the underlying enforceable obligation as specified. This\nbill would require the interest on these loans to be calculated on a\nfixed annual simple basis and would specify the manner in which\nthese loans are required to be repaid.\n   (6) Existing law provides for the transfer of housing assets and\nfunctions previously performed by the dissolved redevelopment agency\nto one of several specified public entities. Existing law authorizes\nthe successor housing entity to designate the use of and commit\nproceeds from indebtedness that were issued for affordable housing\npurposes prior to January 1 2011 and were backed by the Low and\nModerate Income Housing Fund.\n   This bill would instead authorize a successor housing entity to\ndesignate the use of and commit proceeds from indebtedness that\nwere issued for affordable housing purposes prior to June 28 2011.\n   (7) Existing law authorizes the city county or city and county\nthat created a redevelopment agency to elect to retain the housing\nassets and functions previously performed by the redevelopment\nagency. Existing law requires that any funds transferred to the\nhousing successor together with any funds generated from housing\nassets be maintained in a separate Low and Moderate Income Housing\nAsset Fund to be used in accordance with applicable housing-related\nprovisions of the Community Redevelopment Law except as specified.\nExisting law requires the housing successor to provide an annual\nindependent financial audit of the fund to its governing body and to\npost on its Internet Web site specified information.\n   This bill would require that posted information to also include\nspecified amounts received by the city county or city and county.\n   (8) Existing law requires a successor agency to among other\nthings prepare a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule for payments\non enforceable obligations for each 6-month fiscal period.\n   This bill would revise the timeline for the preparation of the\nrequired Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to require the\nsuccessor agency to prepare a schedule for a one year fiscal period\nwith the first of these periods beginning July 1 2016 and would\nauthorize the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to be amended by\nthe oversight board once per Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule\nperiod if the oversight board makes a finding that a revision is\nnecessary for the payment of approved enforceable obligations as\nspecified.\n   This bill would beginning January 1 2015 authorize successor\nagencies to submit a Last and Final Recognized Obligation Payment\nSchedule which shall list the remaining enforceable obligations of\nthe successor agency and the total outstanding obligation and a\nschedule of remaining payments for each enforceable obligation for\napproval by the oversight board and the Department of Finance if\nspecified conditions are met. This bill would require the department\nto review the Last and Final Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule\nas specified and would require upon approval by the department the\nLast and Final Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to establish\nthe maximum amount of Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Funds to be\ndistributed to the successor agency as specified. This bill would\nauthorize the successor agencies to submit no more than 2 requests to\nthe department to amend the approved Last and Final Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule except as specified. This bill would\nalso require the county auditor-controller to review the Last and\nFinal Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule and to continue to\nallocate moneys in the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund in a\nspecified order of priority.\n   (9) Existing law prohibits successor agencies from creating new\nenforceable obligations except in compliance with an enforceable\nobligation that existed prior to June 28 2011. Notwithstanding this\nprovision existing law authorizes successor agencies to create\nenforceable obligations to conduct the work of winding down the\nredevelopment agency including hiring staff acquiring necessary\nprofessional administrative services and legal counsel and procuring\ninsurance. Existing law finds and declares that these provisions\nwhen enacted were declaratory of existing law.\n   This bill except as required by an enforceable obligation would\nexclude certain work from the authorization to create enforceable\nobligations and would prohibit a successor agency that is the city\ncounty or city and county that formed the redevelopment agency from\ncreating enforceable obligations to repay loans entered into between\nthe redevelopment agency and the city county or city and county\nexcept as otherwise provided. This bill would delete those findings\nand declarations and would apply the provisions described above\nretroactively to any successor agency or redevelopment agency actions\noccurring after June 27 2012.\n   (10) Existing law authorizes a successor agency to petition the\nDepartment of Finance if an enforceable obligation provides for an\nirrevocable commitment of property tax revenue and the allocation of\nthose revenues is expected to occur over time to provide written\nconfirmation that its determination of this enforceable obligation as\napproved in a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule is final and\nconclusive.\n   This bill would require the successor agency to petition the\ndepartment by electronic means and in a manner of the department\'s\nchoosing and would require the successor agency to provide a copy of\nthe petition to the county auditor-controller as provided. This\nbill would require the department to provide written confirmation of\napproval or denial of the request within 100 days of the date of the\nrequest.\n   (11) Existing law provides that agreements contracts or\narrangements between the city or county or city and county that\ncreated the redevelopment agency and the redevelopment agency are\ninvalid and shall not be binding on the successor agency except that\na successor entity wishing to enter or reenter into agreements with\nthe city county or city and county that formed the redevelopment\nagency may do so upon obtaining approval of its oversight board.\nExisting law prohibits a successor agency or an oversight board from\nexercising these powers to restore funding for an enforceable\nobligation that was deleted or reduced by the Department of Finance\nas provided.\n   This bill would delete that prohibition and would provide that a\nduly authorized written agreement entered into at the time of\nissuance but in no event later than June 27 2011 of indebtedness\nobligations solely for the refunding or refinancing of indebtedness\nobligations that existed prior to January 1 2011 and solely for the\npurpose of securing or repaying the refunded and refinanced\nindebtedness obligations is valid and may bind the successor agency.\n\n   This bill would prohibit an oversight board from approving any\nagreements between the successor agency and the city county or city\nand county that formed the redevelopment agency except as otherwise\nprovided and would prohibit a successor agency from entering or\nreentering into any agreements with the city county or city and\ncounty that formed the redevelopment agency except as otherwise\nprovided. This bill would also prohibit a successor agency or an\noversight board from exercising any powers to restore funding for any\nitem that was denied or reduced by the Department of Finance. This\nbill would apply these provisions retroactively to all agreements\nentered or reentered on and after June 27 2012.\n   (12) Existing law authorizes the Department of Finance to review\nan oversight board action and requires written notice and information\nabout all actions taken by an oversight board to be provided to the\ndepartment by electronic means and in a manner of the department\'s\nchoosing.\n   This bill would require the written notice and information\ndescribed above to be provided to the department as an approved\nresolution. This bill would provide that oversight boards are not\nrequired to submit certain actions for department approval.\n   (13) Existing law requires on and after July 1 2016 in each\ncounty where more than one oversight board was created as provided\nthat there be only one oversight board.\n   This bill except as otherwise provided commencing on and after\nJuly 1 2018 if more than one oversight board exists within a\ncounty would require the oversight board to be staffed by the county\nauditor-controller by another county entity selected by the county\nauditor-controller or by a city within the county selected by the\ncounty auditor-controller as specified. This bill would authorize\nthe county auditor-controller if only one successor agency exists\nwithin the county to designate the successor agency to staff the\noversight board. This bill commencing July 1 2018 in each county\nwhere more than 40 oversight boards were created would require 5\noversight boards as specified.\n   (14) Existing law requires an oversight board for a successor\nagency to cease to exist when all of the indebtedness of the\ndissolved redevelopment agency has been repaid.\n   This bill would instead generally require an oversight board to\ncease to exist when the successor agency has been formally dissolved\nas specified and would require a county oversight board to cease to\nexist when all successor agencies subject to its oversight have been\nformally dissolved as specified.\n   (15) Existing law upon full payment by a successor agency of\nspecified amounts due requires the Department of Finance to issue a\nfinding of completion as specified within 5 days.\n   This bill if a successor agency fails by December 31 2015 to\npay or to enter into a written installment plan with the Department\nof Finance for payment of specified amounts would prohibit the\nsuccessor agency from ever receiving a finding of completion. This\nbill if a successor agency city county or city and county pays\nor enters into a written installment plan with the Department of\nFinance for the payment of specified amounts and the successor\nagency city county or city and county subsequently receives a\nfinal judicial determination that reduces or eliminates the amounts\ndetermined would require an enforceable obligation to be created for\nthe reimbursement of the excess amounts paid and the obligation to\nmake any payments in excess of the amount determined by a final\ndetermination to be canceled. This bill if upon consultation with\nthe county auditor-controller the Department of Finance finds that a\nsuccessor agency city county or city and county has failed to\nfully make one or more payments agreed to in the written installment\nplan would prohibit specified provisions from applying to the\nsuccessor agency and would prohibit specified oversight board actions\nand any approved long-range property management plan from being\neffective.\n   (16) Existing law transfers all assets properties contracts\nleases books and records buildings and equipment of former\nredevelopment agencies as of February 1 2012 to the control of the\nsuccessor agency for administration as specified.\n   This bill would require the city county or city and county that\ncreated the former redevelopment agency to return to the successor\nagency certain assets cash and cash equivalents that were not\nrequired by an enforceable obligation as specified and other money\nor assets that were not required or authorized pursuant to an\neffective oversight board action or Recognized Obligation Payment\nSchedule. This bill would authorize certain amounts required to be\nreturned to the successor agency to be placed on a Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule by the successor agency for payment as an\nenforceable obligation subject to specified conditions.\n   (17) Existing law requires a request by a successor agency to\nenter into an agreement with the city county or city and county\nthat formed the redevelopment agency to first be approved by the\noversight board. Existing law provides that actions to reestablish\nany other agreements that are in furtherance of enforceable\nobligations with the city county or city and county that formed the\nredevelopment agency are invalid until they are included in an\napproved and valid Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule.\n   This bill would also require a request by the successor agency to\nreenter into an agreement as described above to first be approved by\nthe oversight board. This bill would also provide that actions to\nestablish any other authorized agreements as specified are invalid\nuntil they are included in an approved and valid Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule.\n   (18) Existing law requires the oversight board to direct the\nsuccessor agency to among other things dispose of all assets and\nproperties of the former redevelopment agency except that the\noversight board is authorized to instead direct the successor agency\nto transfer ownership of those assets that were constructed and used\nfor a governmental purpose such as roads school buildings parks\npolice and fire stations libraries and local agency administrative\nbuildings to the appropriate public jurisdiction as provided.\n   This bill would expand that authorization to include parking\nfacilities and lots dedicated solely to public parking that do not\ninclude properties that generate revenues in excess of reasonable\nmaintenance costs of the properties. This bill would authorize a\nsuccessor agency to amend its long-range property management plan\nonce solely to allow for retention of real properties that\nconstitute public parking lots as provided. This bill would provide\nthat a city county city and county or parking district shall not\nbe required to reimburse or pay a successor agency for any funds\nspent by a former redevelopment agency as specified to design and\nconstruct a parking facility.\n   (19) Existing law requires from February 1 2012 to July 1\n2012 inclusive and for each fiscal year thereafter the county\nauditor-controller after deducting administrative costs to allocate\nproperty tax revenues in each Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund\nfirst to each local agency and school entity as provided.\n   This bill would require certain revenues attributable to a\nproperty tax rate approved by the voters of a city county city and\ncounty or special district to make payments in support of pension\nprograms or in support of capital projects and programs related to\nthe State Water Project and levied in addition to the general\nproperty tax rate be allocated to and when collected be paid into\nthe fund of that taxing entity unless those amounts are pledged as\nsecurity for the payment of any indebtedness obligation.\n   (20) Existing law requires certain estimates and accounts reported\nin a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule and transferred to the\nRedevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund to be subject to audit by\nthe county auditor-controller and the Controller.\n   This bill would instead require the estimates and accounts\ndescribed above to be reviewed by the county auditor-controller\nsubject to the Department of Finance\'s review and approval. This bill\nwould require a successor agency commencing October 1 2018 and\neach October 1 thereafter to submit the differences between actual\npayments and past estimated obligations on a Recognized Obligation\nPayment Schedule to the county auditor-controller for review and\nwould require the county-auditor controller to provide this\ninformation to the Department of Finance as specified.\n   (21) Existing law requires a successor agency when all of the\ndebt of a redevelopment agency has been retired or paid off to\ndispose of all remaining assets and terminate its existence within\none year of the final debt payment.\n   This bill would instead require when all of the enforceable\nobligations have been retired or paid off all real property has been\ndisposed of and all outstanding litigation has been resolved the\nsuccessor agency to submit to the oversight board a request with a\ncopy of the request to the county auditor-controller to formally\ndissolve the successor agency. This bill would also require if a\nredevelopment agency was not previously allocated property tax\nrevenue as specified the successor agency to submit to the\noversight board a request to formally dissolve the successor agency.\nThis bill would require the oversight board to approve these requests\nwithin 30 days and to submit the request to the Department of\nFinance for approval or denial as specified. This bill would require\nthe successor agency to take specified steps including notifying\nthe oversight board when the department approves a request to\nformally dissolve a successor agency. This bill would require the\noversight board upon receipt of notification from the successor\nagency to make certain verifications and adopt a final resolution of\ndissolution for the successor agency as specified. This bill would\nwhen a successor agency is finally dissolved with respect to any\nexisting community facilities district formed by a redevelopment\nagency require the legislative body of the city or county that\nformed the redevelopment agency to become the legislative body of the\ncommunity facilities district and any existing obligations of the\nformer redevelopment agency or its successor agency to become the\nobligations of the new legislative body of the community facilities\ndistrict.\n   (22) Existing law with respect to any successor agency that has\nbeen issued a finding of completion by the Department of Finance\ndeems loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency\nand the city county or city and county that created the\nredevelopment agency to be an enforceable obligation as provided.\nExisting law specifies the manner in which the interest on the loan\nshould be calculated and how the loan should be repaid. Existing law\nrequires repayments received by the city county or city and county\nthat formed the redevelopment agency to be used to retire certain\noutstanding amounts borrowed and owed including a distribution to\nthe Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund as provided. Existing\nlaw requires bond proceeds derived from bonds issued on or before\nDecember 31 2010 to be used for the purposes for which the bonds\nwere sold.\n   This bill would define \""loan agreement\"" for the purposes described\nabove would specify the types of documents demonstrating valid loan\nagreements and would prohibit the Department of Finance from\nrequesting more than one of these documents to prove a valid loan\nagreement. This bill would change the manner in which the interest on\nthe loan is calculated and would require moneys repaid to be\napplied first to the principal and second to the interest. This bill\nwould require distributions to the Low and Moderate Income Housing\nAsset Fund to be subject to specified reporting requirements. This\nbill would require bond proceeds derived from bonds issued on or\nbefore December 31 2010 in excess of the amounts needed to satisfy\napproved enforceable obligations to be expended in a manner\nconsistent with the original bond covenants. This bill would require\nbond proceeds derived from bonds issued on or after January 1 2011\nin excess of amounts needed to satisfy approved enforceable\nobligations to be used in a manner consistent with the original bond\ncovenants subject to specified conditions. This bill would apply\nthese provisions and the provisions relating to any successor agency\nthat has been issued a finding of completion by the Department of\nFinance described above retroactively to actions occurring on or\nafter June 28 2011. This bill would also provide that specified\nchanges to existing law shall not result in the denial of specified\nloans previously approved by the Department of Finance and shall not\nimpact judgments writs of mandate and orders entered by the\nSacramento Superior Court in specified lawsuits.\n   (23) Existing law requires a successor agency to prepare a\nlong-range property management plan that addresses the disposition\nand use of the real properties of the former redevelopment agency.\n   This bill would require if the former redevelopment agency did\nnot have real properties the successor agency to prepare a\nlong-range property management plan as provided.\n   (24) Existing law authorizes successor agencies to among other\nthings issue bonds or incur indebtedness to refund the bonds or\nindebtedness of a former redevelopment agency or to finance debt\nservice spikes as specified. The issuance of bonds or incurrence of\nother indebtedness by a successor agency is subject to the approval\nof the oversight board of the successor agency.\n   This bill would authorize the successor agency to the\nRedevelopment Agency of the City and County of San Francisco to have\nthe authority rights and powers of the Redevelopment Agency to\nwhich it succeeded solely for the purpose of issuing bonds or\nincurring other indebtedness to finance the construction of\naffordable housing and infrastructure required by specified\nagreements subject to the approval of the oversight board. The bill\nwould provide that bonds or other indebtedness authorized by its\nprovisions would be considered indebtedness incurred by the dissolved\nredevelopment agency would be listed on the Recognized Obligation\nPayment Schedule and would be secured by a pledge of moneys\ndeposited into the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund. The bill\n                                           would also require the\nsuccessor agency to make diligent efforts to obtain the lowest\nlong-term cost financing and to make use of an independent financial\nadvisor in developing financing proposals.\n   This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to\nthe necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San\nFrancisco.\n   (25) Existing law requires the county auditor for a county for\nwhich a negative sum was calculated pursuant to a specified former\nstatute in reducing the amount of property tax revenue otherwise\nallocated to the county by an amount attributable to that negative\nsum to apply a reduction amount equal to or based on the reduction\namount determined for specified fiscal years.\n   This bill for the 2015-16 fiscal year and each fiscal year\nthereafter would prohibit the county auditor from applying the\nreduction amount.\n   (26) Existing property tax law requires the county auditor in\neach fiscal year to allocate property tax revenue to local\njurisdictions in accordance with specified formulas and procedures\nand generally requires that each jurisdiction be allocated an amount\nequal to the total of the amount of revenue allocated to that\njurisdiction in the prior fiscal year subject to certain\nmodifications and that jurisdiction\'s portion of the annual tax\nincrement as defined. Existing law provides for the computation on\nthe basis of these allocations of apportionment factors that are\napplied to actual property tax revenues in each county in order to\ndetermine actual amounts of property tax revenue received by each\nrecipient jurisdiction.\n   This bill would deem to be correct those property tax revenue\napportionment factors that were applied in allocating property tax\nrevenues in the County of San Benito for each fiscal year through the\n2000-01 fiscal year. This bill would notwithstanding specified\naudit requirements require the county auditor to make the allocation\nadjustments identified in the Controller\'s audit of the County of\nSan Benito for the 2001-02 fiscal year. The bill would additionally\nrequire property tax apportionment factors applied in allocating\nproperty tax revenue in the County of San Benito for the 2002-03\nfiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter to be determined on the\nbasis of apportionment factors for prior fiscal years that have been\ncorrected or adjusted as would be required if those prior\napportionment factors were not deemed correct by this bill.\n   This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to\nthe necessity of a special statute for the County of San Benito.\n   (27) Existing property tax law reduces the amounts of ad valorem\nproperty tax revenue that would otherwise be annually allocated to\nthe county cities and special districts pursuant to general\nallocation requirements by requiring for purposes of determining\nproperty tax revenue allocations in each county for the 1992-93 and\n1993-94 fiscal years that the amounts of property tax revenue deemed\nallocated in the prior fiscal year to the county cities and\nspecial districts be reduced in accordance with certain formulas. It\nrequires that the revenues not allocated to the county cities and\nspecial districts as a result of these reductions be transferred to\nthe Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF) in that county for\nallocation to school districts community college districts and the\ncounty office of education.\n   Existing property tax law requires the auditor of each county with\nqualifying cities as defined to make certain property tax revenue\nallocations to those cities in accordance with a specified Tax Equity\nAllocation (TEA) formula established in a specified statute and to\nmake corresponding reductions in the amount of property tax revenue\nthat is allocated to the county. Existing law requires the auditor of\nSanta Clara County for the 2006-07 fiscal year and for each fiscal\nyear thereafter to reduce the amount of property tax revenue\nallocated to qualified cities in that county by the ERAF\nreimbursement amount as defined and to commensurately increase the\namount of property tax revenue allocated to the county ERAF as\nspecified.\n   This bill would instead for the 2015-16 fiscal year and for each\nfiscal year thereafter require the auditor of Santa Clara County to\nreduce the amount of property tax revenues that are required to be\nallocated from the qualified cities in that county to the county ERAF\nby a specified percentage of the ERAF reimbursement amount. This\nbill would prohibit the auditor of Santa Clara County from reducing\nthe amounts allocated to the county ERAF in any fiscal",
"year in which\nthe amount of moneys required to be applied by the state for the\nsupport of school districts and community college districts is\ndetermined pursuant to Test 1 of Proposition 98.\n   This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to\nthe necessity of a special statute for the County of Santa Clara.\n   (28) This bill would appropriate $23750000 from the General Fund\nto the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection contingent upon\nthe County of Riverside agreeing to forgive amounts owed to it by\ncertain cities.\n   (29) By imposing new duties upon local government officials with\nrespect to the winddown of the dissolved redevelopment agencies and\nin the annual allocation of ad valorem property tax revenues this\nbill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local\nagencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the\nstate. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that\nreimbursement.\n   This bill would provide that if the Commission on State Mandates\ndetermines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state\nreimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these\nstatutory provisions.\n   (30) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately\nas a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.\n   Appropriation: yes.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  SECTION 1.

Employee costs\nassociated with work on specific project implementation activities\nincluding but not limited to construction inspection project\nmanagement or actual construction shall be considered\nproject-specific costs and shall not constitute administrative costs.\n\n   (c) \""Designated local authority\"" shall mean a public entity formed\npursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 34173.\n   (d) (1) \""Enforceable obligation\"" means any of the following:\n   (A) Bonds as defined by Section 33602 and bonds issued pursuant\nto Chapter 10.5 (commencing with Section 5850) of Division 6 of Title\n1 of the Government Code including the required debt service\nreserve set-asides and any other payments required under the\nindenture or similar documents governing the issuance of the\noutstanding bonds of the former redevelopment agency.

The successor agency or designated local\nauthority shall enter into an agreement with the housing entity to\nreimburse it for any costs of the employee obligations.\n   (D) Judgments or settlements entered by a competent court of law\nor binding arbitration decisions against the former redevelopment\nagency other than passthrough payments that are made by the county\nauditor-controller pursuant to Section 34183.

The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the\nfollowing:\n   (a) The Department of Finance has provided written confirmation to\nthe successor agency to the Redevelopment Agency of the City and\nCounty of San Francisco (successor agency) that the following\nprojects are finally and conclusively approved as enforceable\nobligations:\n   (1) The Mission Bay North Owner Participation Agreement.\n   (2) The Mission Bay South Owner Participation Agreement.\n   (3) The Disposition and Development Agreement for Hunters Point\nShipyard Phase 1.\n   (4) The Candlestick Point-Hunters Point Shipyard Phase 2\nDisposition and Development Agreement.\n   (5) The Transbay Implementation Agreement.\n   (b) The enforceable obligations described in subdivision (a)\nrequire the successor agency to fund and develop affordable housing\nincluding 1200 units in Transbay 1445 units in Mission Bay North\nand Mission Bay South and 1358 units in Candlestick Point-Hunters\nPoint Shipyard Phases 1 and 2. In addition the successor agency is\nrequired to fund and develop public infrastructure in the Transbay\nRedevelopment Project Area pursuant to the Transbay Implementation\nAgreement which is necessary to improve the area surrounding the\nTransbay Transit Center.\n   (c) Due to insufficient property tax revenues in the Redevelopment\nProperty Tax Trust Fund of the total number of affordable housing\nunits that the successor agency is obligated to fund and develop\nunder the enforceable obligations described in subdivision (a) the\nsuccessor agency has been able to finance the construction of only\n642 units. Additionally the successor agency has not been able to\nfulfill its public infrastructure obligation under the Transbay\nImplementation Agreement.\n   (d) The successor agency can more expeditiously construct the\n3361 additional units of required affordable housing and the\nnecessary infrastructure improvements if it is able to issue bonds or\nincur other indebtedness secured by property tax revenues available\nin the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund to finance these\nobligations.\n   (e) It is the intent of the Legislature to authorize the successor\nagency to issue bonds or incur other indebtedness for the purpose of\nfinancing the construction of affordable housing and infrastructure\nrequired under the enforceable obligations described in subdivision\n(a). These bonds or other indebtedness may be secured by property tax\nrevenues available in the successor agency\'s Redevelopment Property\nTax Trust Fund from those project areas that generated tax increment\nfor the Redevelopment Agency of the City and County of San Francisco\nupon its dissolution if the revenues are not otherwise obligated.\n   (f) Authorizing the successor agency to issue bonds or incur other\nindebtedness to finance the enforceable obligations described in\nsubdivision (a) will financially benefit the affected taxing\nentities insofar as it will ensure that funds which would otherwise\nflow to those entities as \""residual\"" payments pursuant to paragraph\n(4) of subdivision (a) of Section 34183 of the Health and Safety Code\nwill not be redirected to fund these enforceable obligations.\nInstead the enforceable obligations will be funded with the proceeds\nof the bonds or debt issuances.\n   (g) The housing situation in the City and County of San Francisco\nis unique in that median rents and sales prices are among the\nhighest in the state. Because of this the City and County of San\nFrancisco is currently facing an affordable housing crisis.\n  SEC. 28.  (a) For the 2015-16 fiscal year the sum of twenty-three\nmillion seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($23750000) is hereby\nappropriated from the General Fund to the Department of Forestry and\nFire Protection. Provision of these funds to the department shall be\ncontingent on the County of Riverside agreeing to forgive amounts\nowed to it by the Cities of Eastvale Jurupa Valley Menifee and\nWildomar for services rendered to the cities between the respective\ndates of their incorporation and June 30 2015.

The agreement reflects a\nvalid public purpose which benefits the cities the county and its\ncitizens.\n   (b) Within 30 days of receiving notification from the county as\nspecified in subdivision (a) the Director of Finance shall do all of\nthe following:\n   (1) Verify the accuracy of the county\'s summary of the amounts\nowed to it by the four cities.\n   (2) Direct the Controller to transmit to the department from the\nappropriation provided in subdivision (a) an amount that corresponds\nto the amount that the Director of Finance has verified pursuant to\nparagraph (1).\n   (3) Initiate steps to reduce the amount of reimbursements provided\nto the department in the Budget Act of 2015 by an amount that\ncorresponds to the amount provided to the department pursuant to\nparagraph (2).\n  SEC. 29.  (a) The Legislature finds and declares that the special\nlaw contained in Section 9 of this measure is necessary and that a\ngeneral law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section\n16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique\ncircumstances relating to affordable housing in the City and County\nof San Francisco in conjunction with the affordable housing and\ninfrastructure requirements of the enforceable obligations specified\nin this act.\n   (b) The Legislature finds and declares that the special law\ncontained in Section 25 of this measure is necessary and that a\ngeneral law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section\n16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the\nuniquely severe fiscal difficulties being suffered by the County of\nSan Benito.\n   (c) The Legislature finds and declares that the special law\ncontained in Section 26 of this measure is necessary and that a\ngeneral law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section\n16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique\nfiscal pressures being experienced by qualifying cities as defined\nin Section 98 of the Revenue and Taxation Code in the County of\nSanta Clara.\n  SEC. 30.
